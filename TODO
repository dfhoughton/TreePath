Roadmap of planned changes.

key:
  . item awaiting attention
  - deprecated item
  * item completed

Periodically I'll clear out this list, moving completed and deprecated items to a sort of
historical holding pen at the end.

TODO
====

. make attribute tests available as arguments to attributes
. create extension class with basic attributes copied from XPath
. differentiate @self and @this; the former is the node relative to which
  the attribute is evaluated and the latter is the node that generated the
  collection being filtered
. add a unit test for every attribute declared

RELICS
======

Things swept out of TODO list:

* implement syntax for attribute value tests: //foo[@bar = 1]
* make context collection available to attributes
* add identity comparison
* make most classes only package-accessible to simplify API
* allow negative indexing
* make Path.select(N) return a list rather than a collection for convenience
* make everything serializable
* make attribute tests symmetric
- test method signatures of attributes during construction
* let Forester ignore nodes matching particular NodeTests
* allow colons in attribute and tag names without escaping
* create != operator
* add @log attribute for debugging
* add tests to ensure foresters are reusable
* fix siblings method
* add kids method so that all nodes are passed by the ignore list
* add id() and @id
* create axis tests
* add same generation method
