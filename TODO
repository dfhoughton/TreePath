Roadmap of planned changes.

key:
  . item awaiting attention
  - deprecated item
  * item completed

Periodically I'll clear out this list, moving completed and deprecated items to a sort of
historical holding pen at the end.

TODO
====

* implement syntax for attribute value tests: //foo[@bar = 1]
. make everything serializable
. make attribute tests symmetric
. test method signatures of attributes during construction
* make context collection available to attributes
* add identity comparison
. make attribute tests available as arguments to attributes
. create extension class with basic attributes copied from XPath
* make most classes only package-accessible to simplify API
* allow negative indexing
. differentiate @self and @this; the former is the node relative to which
  the attribute is evaluated and the latter is the node that generated the
  collection being filtered
. let Forester ignore nodes matching particular NodeTests
. allow colons in attribute and tag names without escaping
. make Path.select(N) return a list rather than a collection for convenience
