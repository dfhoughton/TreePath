TreePath
========

A library which compiles XPath-like expressions into objects that allow
one to perform queries on any tree data structure, obtaining a list of
nodes that match the query expression.

At this point nothing is fixed. The general idea is that this will look as
much as possible like XPath, and function as much as possible in the same
way, while not expecting the trees queried to have any XML-specific properties.
